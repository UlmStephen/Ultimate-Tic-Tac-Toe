# Ultimate Tic Tac Toe

This program was my Software Engineering Technology Capstone.

It is a game where there are 9 tic tac toe boards, and each square of the tic tac toe board sends your opponent to the equivalent board, IE the top left square sends your opponent to the top left board. 
Winning three boards in a row wins the game.

The AI ranks each move by how good a move is on was on the current board, and compares it to how bad it is to sent the opponent to the board that that button sends them to.
